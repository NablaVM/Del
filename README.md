## Development Updates:

The Del Compiler is on its way, and recently pulled out of the Nabal VM application. Initially I thought it would a good idea to couple the compiler with the virtual machine, but I recently decided against doing that. This is an application specifically to compile the Del language to Nabla Bytecode that can then be executed by the [NablaVM](https://github.com/NablaVM/nabla).
